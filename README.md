# Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) Two-Phase Bubble Fluid Simulation with WebGL

**See a live demo here:** https://mjwatkins2.github.io/WebGL-SPH/ 

For COMP 559 @ McGill University. Implementation of a two-phase SPH fluid, with buoyancy, cohesion and drag forces on the light air. Based on https://cg.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publications/2011_GRAPP_airBubbles.pdf by Markus Ihmsen et al. Responds to mouse movement on desktop, and touch input on mobile.

**Credits:** Based off of an SPH fluid sim template from https://github.com/mjwatkins2/WebGL-SPH.
