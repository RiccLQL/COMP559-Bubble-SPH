# Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) Two-Phase Bubble Fluid Simulation with WebGL

**See a live demo here:** https://sweet-pixie-695a4b.netlify.app/

- For COMP 559 @ McGill University.
- Implementation of a two-phase SPH fluid, with buoyancy, cohesion and drag forces on the light air.
- By default, it simulates turbulent airflow and the creation of bubbles in water (bottom fluid).
- Based on https://cg.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publications/2011_GRAPP_airBubbles.pdf by Markus Ihmsen et al.
- Responds to mouse movement on desktop, and touch input on mobile.
- Please use a browser that supports WebGL (like Google Chrome).
